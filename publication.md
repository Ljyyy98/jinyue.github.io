We show that a pseudo representation of a finite group need not arise from a genuine
representation, even if one is allowed to extend the coefficient ring. This shows that a theorem of the “embed-
ding problem” for residually multiplicity free pseudorepresentations can not be extended to the gen-
eral setting.
